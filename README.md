# Nicholson-Bailey

These scipts were written to explore the Nicholson-Bailey model when hosts and parasites can reproduce sexually (mixing of genotypes) or asexually (no mixing). They exist both in a Matlab version (that is more developed) and in a python version I made to see if it would work.

The python version works just as well, but is less worked through and a little less advanced. 

The formulas used in these scripts were taken from the article "A Bit of Sex Stabilizes Host+Parasite Dynamics" by THOMAS FLATT, NICOLAS MAIRE and MICHAEL DOEBELI, J. theor. Biol. (2001) 212, 345}354 (doi:10.1006/jtbi.2001.2380). 

The results deviate a little from the results in the article, but similar conclusions about the stability can be made. It is up to future students/interested people to develop the scripts further.
